# Psychology Literature Search System

## üîç Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent scientific literature search and analysis system specifically for psychology journals. Unlike traditional keyword-based search systems, this tool leverages natural language processing and semantic understanding to help researchers find relevant academic papers more efficiently.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Query Processing
- Accept complex research questions in natural language format
- Process and understand the semantic meaning behind queries
- Match query intent with relevant published literature

### Research Question Verification
- Determine if specific research questions have already been addressed in published literature
- Identify papers that directly answer posed research questions
- Save researchers time by preventing duplication of existing work

### Semantic Clustering and Visualization
- Create visual maps of research paper clusters based on semantic similarity
- Automatically classify papers into meaningful topics using machine learning
- Provide interactive navigation through the research landscape

## Technical Approach
The system will utilize:
- Advanced NLP techniques for query processing
- Semantic embedding and vector similarity search
- Deep learning approaches for document clustering
- Modern web interface for intuitive user interaction

##  Initial Focus
The prototype will focus on Frontiers psychology journals since they offer open access to their database, making them ideal for this development phase.

## Long-Term Vision
This project aims to demonstrate how academic publishers could enhance their platforms with intelligent search capabilities, improving discoverability of their published works and supporting more efficient research workflows.
